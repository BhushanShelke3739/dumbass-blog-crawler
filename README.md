# dumbass-blog-crawler
Crawler for posts of a blog, does require LLM for cleaning but you guys can use the crawling logic, maybe add your ip rotation logic, shit will work like a charm!

Upload the urls' of blogsites you want to crawl in sites1.json file!

```bash
python da_crawler.py --sites-file sites1.json
```
